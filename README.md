# JS-Calculator
A classic calculator project to practice vanilla JavaScript. Included my first exposure to using the HTML data- attribute to allow easy access to the different buttons on the calculator dependent on their type/key.
The main logic I had to consider was in regards to what should be displayed when a particular type  of button ('number' , 'operator' or 'equals') is clicked by the user.
